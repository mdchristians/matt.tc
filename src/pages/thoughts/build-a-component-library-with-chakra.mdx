summary: 'Building a constraint-based component library for your design system with Chakra'

## TL;DR

Chakra v1 gives you the options to not only extend the components but reconfigure them. Along with changing the theme, you have the option to create new variants and styles for individual components along with extending the design tokens. With Chakra, you can build your own branded component library without the hassle of incorporating setting up components with styled-system and emotion manually. And bonus, they’re accessible out of the box.

## Why Chakra?

Awhile back I was looking at creating a new component library to fit into a design system. My goal here was to have something I could easily kickstart new projects with, while retaining the ability to give each project it’s own look and feel.

As a huge fan of [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), I decided to start there and build away. After setting up some of the basic structure with a theme provider and a base theme, I began on everyone’s favorite component: the `Button`.

It didn’t take too long to start running into, more or less, architecture and design issues. Finding the balance between the flexibility of extending or restructuring the design tokens while making sure component states, appearances, and variants all looked correct ended up being a lot of – more than I wanted to put in for this simple project. I started looking around at what other libraries, also using styled-system and some styled-components-like library were doing, which is where I found Chakra’s v1 beta.

It’s important to note that I’m talking about [Chakra-ui v1](https://next.chakra-ui.com/), which still requires the next tag when accessing it at the time of writing.

Chakra was doing exactly what I had envisioned when creating their own components internally, so it was a delight when I found out they actually expose those utilities. Most of this is even documented in Chakra’s new documentation, so I’ll reference helpers where possible.

So, let’s begin.

## Setting up a theme

Chakra uses it’s own [default theme](https://next.chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme) out of the box so extending and overwriting certain tokens is the first place we’re going to start. Normally when doing this, we’d have to do something like:

```jsx
import defaultTheme from '@chakra-ui/theme';

export const theme = {
  ...defaultTheme,
  colors: {
    ...defaultTheme.colors,
    primary: {
      main: '#7048e8',
      hover: '#9775fa',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#1098ad',
      hover: '#3bc9db',
    },
  },
};
```

However, we can use the `extendTheme` function to make sure we’re keeping both the default value objects and functions while replacing or extending the theme with our additions like so...

```jsx
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/core';

export const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7048e8',
      hover: '#9775fa',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#1098ad',
      hover: '#3bc9db',
    },
  },
});
```

Assuming we're going to add more tokens to our theme down the road, I like to add `colors.js` and `index.js` files in a `tokens` directory, which would then be located inside our main `theme` directory, so we'd end up with something like this:

```jsx tabs
/** theme/index.js **/
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/core';
import { colors } from './tokens';

export const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    ...colors,
  },
});

/** theme/tokens/index.js **/
export { default as colors } from './colors';

/** theme/tokens/colors.js **/
const colors = {
  primary: {
    main: '#7048e8',
    hover: '#9775fa',
  },
  secondary: {
    main: '#1098ad',
    hover: '#3bc9db',
  },
};

export default colors;
```

## Customizing components

Now this is extremely basic and doesn't really say much about extending Chakra into your own unique library, so let's take it a step farther. Say we want to completely change the way the base button looks and the different variants we could use with it...

Chakra gives us the ability to also customize the various components it ships with by adding a `components` key to our theme. Using this, we can create the `Button` component with a variant (solid, outline) and appearance (default, primary, secondary) props that use our theme's tokens. Note - Chakra ships with both of these out of the box, however in this example we're trading the default `colorScheme` prop to our own `appearance` prop.

So assuming we're going to extend our library even farther down the road, we'll create a `components` directory inside the theme `directory`, followed by two files called `buttons.js` and our `index.js`.

For our new button styles, we get the [base and modifier styles](https://next.chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/component-style#base-styles-and-modifier-styles) (`baseStyle`, `sizes`, `variants`, and `defaultProps`) to play around with and can define the styles for sizes or variants with either an object or a function that returns a style object. So let's take create the options talked about above.

```jsx named
/** theme/components/buttons.js **/
import { transparentize } from '@chakra-ui/theme-tools';

// We'll use this helper function to get the button's "state" styles
const getShadow = (appearance, theme) => {
  return appearance === 'default'
    ? `0 0 0 3px rgba(134, 142, 150, 0.6)`
    : `0 0 0 3px ${transparentize(appearance, 0.6)(theme)}`;
};

const button = {
  baseStyle: {
    lineHeight: '1.2',
    borderRadius: 'md',
    fontWeight: 'normal',
    _focus: {
      boxShadow: 'outline',
    },
    _disabled: {
      opacity: 0.4,
      cursor: 'not-allowed',
      boxShadow: 'none',
    },
  },
  variants: {
    solid: ({ appearance, theme }) => {
      if (appearance === 'default') {
        return {
          bg: 'gray.600',
          color: 'white',
          _hover: {
            bg: 'gray.700',
          },
          _active: {
            bg: 'gray.700',
          },
          _focus: {
            bg: 'gray.700',
          },
        };
      }

      return {
        bg: appearance,
        color: 'white',
        _hover: { bg: transparentize(appearance, 0.9)(theme) },
        _active: { bg: transparentize(appearance, 0.9)(theme) },
        _focus: {
          bg: transparentize(appearance, 0.9)(theme),
          boxShadow: getShadow(appearance, theme),
        },
      };
    },
    outline: ({ appearance, theme }) => {
      if (appearance === 'default') {
        return {
          bg: 'transparent',
          border: 'solid 1px',
          borderColor: 'gray.800',
          color: 'gray.500',
          _hover: {
            bg: 'gray.500',
            borderColor: 'gray.500',
            color: 'white',
          },
          _active: {
            bg: 'gray.500',
            borderColor: 'gray.500',
            color: 'white',
          },
          _focus: {
            bg: 'gray.500',
            borderColor: 'gray.500',
            color: 'white',
          },
        };
      }

      return {
        bg: 'transparent',
        border: 'solid 1px',
        borderColor: appearance,
        color: appearance,
        _hover: {
          bg: appearance,
          borderColor: appearance,
          color: 'white',
        },
        _active: {
          bg: appearance,
          borderColor: appearance,
          color: 'white',
          boxShadow: getShadow(appearance, theme),
        },
        _focus: {
          bg: appearance,
          borderColor: appearance,
          color: 'white',
          boxShadow: getShadow(appearance, theme),
        },
      };
    },
  },
  sizes: {
    lg: {
      h: 12,
      minW: 12,
      fontSize: 'lg',
      px: 6,
    },
    md: {
      h: 10,
      minW: 10,
      fontSize: 'md',
      px: 4,
    },
    sm: {
      h: 8,
      minW: 8,
      fontSize: 'sm',
      px: 3,
    },
    xs: {
      h: 6,
      minW: 6,
      fontSize: 'xs',
      px: 2,
    },
  },
  defaultProps: {
    variant: 'solid',
    size: 'md',
    appearance: 'default',
  },
};

export default button;
```

We can then add that to our index.js (and the rest of components we eventually create) to make importing a bit cleaner.

```jsx named
/** theme/components/index.js **/
import button from './button';

export default {
  Button: button,
};
```

Finally, we can then add that to our main theme to be consumed!

```jsx named
/** theme/index.js **/
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/core';
import components from './components';
import { colors } from './tokens';

export const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    ...colors,
  },
  components: {
    ...components,
  },
});
```
